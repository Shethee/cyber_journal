## Hash Values (Trival)
-> Hashing algorithm - MD5(Messege Digest, Defined by RFC 1321 Link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt \
=> MD5 RFC 1321 hashes are not considered cryptographycally secure. but RFC 6151(LINK:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6151) , Updated security considerations for the MD5 message digest and the HMAC-MD5 algorithms which mentioned a number of attacks against MD5 hashes, Including the hash collision.
=> Sha-1(Secure Hash Algorithm 1, defined by RFC 3174) when data is fed tp sha-1 hashing algorithm, sha-1 takes an input and produce a 160 bit hash value string as a 40 digit hexadecimal number. NIST deprected the use of sha-1 in 2011 and banned its use for digital signatiures at the end of 2013 based on it being susceptible to brute force attacks. Indtead NIST recommends migrating from SHA-1 to stronger hash algorithms in the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families. \
